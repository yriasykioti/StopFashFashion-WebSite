# StopFashFashion-WebSite

In the context of an academic assignment, we created a website using HTML, jsp, SQL and Java.

## Stop Fast Fashion

Stop Fast Fashion is an online platform where people can sell, buy and donate
to NGOs their clothes in order to reduce the mass production of the fashion
industry and therefore protect our planet.
